# Precision Medicine: Accessing Warfarin Sensitivity using Pharmacogenomics

## Pharmacogenomics
Pharmacogenomics aim to better understand how individual's genes affect their response to medications. While a majority of human DNA is identical, there are sequence variations that lead to different versions of the same gene. These are known as polymorphisms, and occur in individuals and populations. These differences, while seemingly small, can affect how drugs are uniquely absorbed, metabolized, and excreted in the body. This explains why responses to certain treatments vary. For this reason, Pharmacogenomics aims at understanding the root problem instead of finding a one-fits-all approach to treating symptoms.

This image shows a Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) which is when the variant is a singluar base switch. SNPs are the most common form of polymorphisms.

### The History of Pharmacogenomics

The beginning of pharmacogenomics dates back to 510 B.C. when Pythagoras observed that eating fava beans caused fatal results for select individuals. However, lack of technology and understanding of genetics meant that no one during this time could provide a hypothetical hypothesis as to why. It took almost 2000 years before the huuman geneticist Friedrich Vogel discovered the enzyme polymorphism Glucose 6 Phosphate Dehydrogenase gene which predisposed thoseo with a mutation to hemolytic anemia in the presence of certain foods and chemicals. Two of these chemicals (vivine and covicine) which caused fatal hemolytic anemia were in fava beans which finally answered why some people could not ingest them safely.

Using Gel Electrophoresis, more polymorphisms were discovered which impacted how medications and chemicals were distributed to patients. For example, polymorphisms in the liver enzyme CYP2D6 were found to contribute to atypical reactions to regulated drug doses. This was observed when administering the pain killer codeine. This drug is usually gradually converted by the liver into its active form morphine. However, some people had variations in their DNA which lead to having thousands of copies of the gene instead of just two. This results in the body catalyzing codeine too quickly and results in overdoses. The adverse affect was also observed in some cases where some people's gene coded for a different protein stucture, resulting in the drug never metabolizing correctly.

Another polymorphism discovery in the late 1900s was 

### Understanding the Cause, Instead of Treating the Symptoms

Diving deeper, Pharmacogenomics aims at understanding the root problem instead of finding a one-fits-all approach to treating symptoms. To do this, we have to understand 3 main components. The first is when the drug targets binding to receptors on cells. In this case, a person being helped by the drug relies on the receptors recognizing the drug. Gene differences mean that some people might have less receptors or no receptors that can do this. The second is uptake which is when the drug targets the cells. Physiological variations means some people will have higher cell permeability for the drug than others. Thirdly, an individual's DNA affects how quickly a drug is broken down, and excreted which affects the correct dosage.

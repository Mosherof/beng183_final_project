# Precision Medicine: Accessing Warfarin Sensitivity using Pharmacogenomics

## Pharmacogenomics
Pharmacogenomics aim to better understand how individual's genes affect their response to medications. While a majority of human DNA is identical, there are sequence variations that lead to different versions of the same gene. This explains why responses to certain treatments vary.

Pharmacogenomics aims at understanding the root problem instead of finding a one-fits-all approach to treating symptoms. One example is the research from the 1970s which looked at the liver enzyme CYP2D6. It was found that polymorphisms contribute to atypical reactions to a regulated dose of drugs. For example, codeine is often given to patients in pain which is gradually converted into its active form, morphine. However, some people have hundreds or even thousands copies of the gene instead of two. This can result in the body catalyzing the drug too quickly and result in overdoses. Adversely, some peopleâ€™s enzymes have a different structure resulting in the drug never having the desired effects. For this reason, it is important to know why these unexpected side effects occur:
